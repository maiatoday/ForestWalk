# Forest Walk

An experimentation in Kotlin notebooks and Lsystems. This is the companion project to the talk titled:

A Walk in the *Lindenmayer Fractal* Forest with a *Kotlin* Notebook

See the matching wandering walk in the [Notebook](https://github.com/maiatoday/ForestWalk/blob/main/book/Forest.ipynb) This notebook is viewable in github. If you want to play with the notebook, you need to clone the project and open it in IntelliJ IDEA. 

Find the source of the canvas drawing and the Lsystem code in the src directory.

> A road's... meaning derives entirely from the two points that it connects...it's like a rope leading from one place to another. A path, by contrast, is a tribute to space.... \[it\] crosses space. It opens up a wood or a valley... it is a source of revelation and discovery.
